# shell I/O redirections and filters scripts
for 103-the_biggest_fan challenge and 101-gifs the script is doing exactly what the exercice is asking for yet it does not check intirely need to be checked later, same goes for the 103... exercice the thing is i got right logically and the script performed the asked task but it did not get similar results like the photo also need to be checked although objectif is done according to description.
the mandatory challenge is fine note that there are more case uses and syntax variants to use for better results because most i found is through awk and sed which seemed more simple.
Notes: 
A good thing i understood is that counting occurence or duplicate with uniq need the list to sorted first
Sorting after modifying a file should get everythin in one line like the acronis challenge
[!.] it means don't include . in the name of file if used with find command
Delimeters are interesting and actually make sense now you just need to find an occurent one byte char or space, to limit cutting with field before and after using the -f 'numberoffield' option and syntax always start of the start point of research in find example : find .(start point in this case current dir) option option
I still struggle with better ways to use grep command so guys don't hesitate to ask about it!
trace command is useful yet cut seems to out perform it in removing and such, note for me check it more!
